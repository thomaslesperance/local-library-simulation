# Local Library Simulation

## Context
This project was completed to demonstrate fundamental JavaScript skills (e.g., higher-order functions, DOM manipulation) through a simulation of a web application controlling a local library where books can be viewed, checked in and out, and where stats on the library can be displayed.

## How to Use
1. Fork and clone repo
2. npm install
3. Start with Live Server (VSCode)

The project does not draw from any external databases. When started with a local test web server, the UI will look like the following:

## Features
The application provides the following features based on the data saved in the accounts.js/ authors.js/ books.js files and the corresponding logic in the src files:

-- How many total books/ books currently checked out/ accounts registered in the library

-- List of 5 most popular genres based on the number of book check-outs recorded in database

-- List of 5 most popular books based on the number of book check-outs recorded in database

-- List of 5 most popular authors based on the number of book check-outs recorded in database

-- Separate pages for authors and books with more details about those aspects of the library

## Technologies and Tools
-- JavaScript/ HTML/ CSS

-- Bootstrap

## Conclusion
Future goals for this code include drawing from the logic, application structure, and data manipulation concepts for other more sophisticated projects.
